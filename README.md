## About

nsMail is a contact/mail page solution I developed without using any databases. To maintain privacy and security, I utilized Discord to store messages for free. By integrating webhook technology with my website, any feedback or messages sent through the form are automatically stored in my Discord server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is designed for personal use. However, you are welcome to use the source code, edit it, and make it your own. Be sure to update the webhook `URL` in your `.env.local` file with your own configuration to ensure it works properly.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
