                When you sign up, we ask for your username, name, and email. This is just so we know
                it's really you logging in! Think of it like a secret handshake. We only ask for
                what we need to let you use the site. We promise we won't ask for your address,
                phone number, or anything else unless you tell us it's okay.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                We use your login details to make sure you're you! We use a super secure service
                called Clerk to do this â€“ it's like a really good lock on a door. This helps us
                manage your account so you can get to all the awesome notes. We won't share your
                info with anyone else, and we won't use it to send you ads or anything like that.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                We use top-notch security to keep your info safe. We use Clerk for logins (like a
                bodyguard for your account) and Supabase to store your data (like a super strong
                vault). Only people who are logged in can download the notes, and all the notes are
                uploaded by Priyanshu, so you know they're safe.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground md:text-base lg:text-lg">
                We don't use cookies (those little files that websites use to track you) or any
                other sneaky tricks to see what you're doing on our site. We respect your privacy,
                and we want you to feel safe.

                You have the right to know what info we have about you, and you can ask us to delete
                it anytime. Just send us a message, and we'll help you out. It's like having a
                "delete" button for your info.
